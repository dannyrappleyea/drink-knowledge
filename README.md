# Drink Knowledge
This is my alcholic drinks knowledge repository. I use it for:
- tracking drinks I've tried and what I think of them
- cocktail recipes
- notes about drinks

It's stored in [conceptual knowledge](https://github.com/digitalreplica/conceptual-knowledge/blob/main/concept/conceptual%20knowledge.md) format. Opening it in a notes application that supports [[wikilink|wikilinks]] lets you navigate easily between all the notes. It builds on concepts in the [conceptual-knowledge-drinks](https://github.com/dannyrappleyea/conceptual-knowledge-drinks) repository. 

Practically speaking, that just means beer is stored in the `beer` folder, etc.

## Naming conventions
- Names often duplicate, so I generally follow a naming convention of adding the brewery, distillery, etc in parentheses, like `Stout (Foothills Brewing)`.
- The data comes from a variety of sources including the drinks themselves, where I have it, websites, and online sources like [Untappd](https://untappd.com/).

## Rating system
I'm moving slowly to a Netflix-style rating system, which is a subjective measure of how much I like it. 

rating | meaning
--- | ---
👎 | Don't like it
<br/> | It's okay
👍 | Like it
👍👍 | Love it

For example, I don't like many sour beers, so something that's amazing to people who like them might get a 👎 from me.
