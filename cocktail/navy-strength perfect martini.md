# Intro
Gin seems to get lost in a perfect martini. Using navy-strength gin brings it back (perhaps even too much?)

# Ingredients
* 2 oz navy-strength gin
* 1 oz extra dry vermouth
* 1 oz sweet vermouth
* 2-3 dashes peychaud bitters

# Directions
* Add all ingredients

# Notes
* Maybe try 1 oz gin and 1 oz navy-strength

# Variations
- 1.5 oz navy strength gin, 0.75 oz gin, 1.5 oz dry vermouth, 0.75 oz sweet vermouth, 1 tsp marachino cherry syrup. Two sweet and muddied
- 1 oz navy strength gin, 0.75 oz dry vermouth, 0.5 oz sweet vermouth. gin still seems to have to sharp a bite.
- 1 oz navy strength gin, 1 oz gin, 1 oz dry vermouth, 1 oz sweet vermouth. Quite nice
