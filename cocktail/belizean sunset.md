# Intro
An attempt to recreate a long-forgotten recipe from a Belizean resort.

# Ingredients
* 1.5 oz One Barrel Rum
* 0.75oz Coconut rum
* 0.75oz Cointreau or other orange liqueur
* 2   oz pineapple juice
* 0.5-1 tsp grenadine

# Directions
Mix everything except grenadine with ice. Shake. Strain into rocks or old fashioned glass. Drizzle grenadine into the drink, so it sinks to the bottom to create a color gradient.

# Notes
- One Barrel is a dark rum from Belize, so any dark rum will substitute.
