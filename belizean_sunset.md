# Belizean Sunset
An attempt to recreate a long-forgotten recipe from a Belizean resort.

## Ingredients
* 1.5 oz One Barrel Rum
* 0.75oz Coconut rum
* 0.75oz Cointreau or other orange liqueur
* 2   oz pineapple juice
* 0.5-1 tsp grenadine

## Directions
Mix everything except grenadine with ice. Shake. Strain into rocks or old fashioned glass. Drizzle grenadine into the drink, so it sinks to the bottom to create a color gradient.

## Notes
One Barrel is a darker rum from Belize, so any dark rum will substitute.
