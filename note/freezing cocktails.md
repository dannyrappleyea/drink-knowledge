# Notes
Can you make several at once and store in the freezer for quick cocktails?
* Most of these shouldn't freeze, so should get colder than stirring with ice, with less dilution.
* Long storage might pick up freezer smells, or mix with air.
* Cocktail purists will shake their heads in shame
* So much easier to measure in larger quantities.

So far:
* Seems thicker, a touch syrupy. Nice actually
* Far colder than with ice, that sought-for "shockingly cold"
